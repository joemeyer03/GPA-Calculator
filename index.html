        <h2>What is a GPA calculator</h2>
        <!--first answer-->
        <p2>
            There are two types of GPA's which we calculate:<br>
            <strong> Weighted </strong> takes into account all the honors and AP classes - 5.3 scale <br>
            <strong> Unweighted </strong> treats every class as the same - 4.3 scale 
        </p2>

        <!--second question-->
        <h2> Why is this important?</h2>
        <!--second answer-->
        <p2>
            A GPA is crucial to the college admissions process. Colleges look at this value to evaluate the academic performance of a particular student over the course of his or her high school career. Every school weights classes differently, so GPAs vary differently at each school. This calculator is built to work specificly for MCST.

        <!--third question-->	
        <h2>How does this work?</h2>
        <!--third answer-->
        <p2>
            We use the information in the student hand book to calculate the GPA with the information you provide. To start, select a marking period at the top, then enter the rest of the information. Enter your grades as a number and then check the box directly to the right if the class is honors or AP. If your academy is two seperate classes, you can click the split button under the academy class name. Finally, if you do not take a class you can select the void button.
        </p2>

		<!--third question-->	
        <h2>What is a cumulative GPA?</h2>
        <!--third answer-->
        <p2>
			A cumulative GPA is the average of the combination of your GPA's across the years.
